# Wack-A-Mole
### An app for aspiring comedians to make, update, view and delete their jokes.
Developer created a Wack-A-Mole game board for the front end, with a back-end API that a user can create, view, update and delete their game comments after playing a game.

The game was inspired after creating a tic-tac-toe game. One wanted to create a 9 boxed board with Wack-A-Mole game logic, as well create a backend API, allowing users to create, view, update and delete all their game comments to the scores of the game they played.

## Scope of Project
#### Design and implement API
#### Design and implement client
#### Deploy apps to heroku and live site
#### Make API for front end and back end
#### Make a repository for both front end and back end
#### via heroku and github

## Work flow - Planning and Development
## Back end API
#### As a developer, I created an api that allows for CRUD actions on score commentaries on single user ID. To ensure this, I created models, controllers, routes and developed schemas for tables in which a user (resource 1) can have access to many games (resource 2) to CRUD their comments to scores after each game played.

## On the front end...
#### 1.) I developed an ERD of the one user to many games diagram
#### 2.) I wrote out user stories (link is below):
#### a.) For authorizations
#### b.) For creating, viewing, updating and deleting their scores
#### 3.) Created a wireframe of several pages describing the user
#### experience and interface (view link below)
#### 4.) I utilized notes taken from General Assembly
#### 5.) Worked on the back end first
#### 6.) Worked on the front end second
#### 7.) Within the front end, I worked on each folder and file
#### one at a time.
#### 8.) The process would entail, work on one part of a feature (e.g.
#### sign-up, sign-out, scores, commentary, gameboard, etc.), then test.
#### 9.) Add and commit on a success on feature
#### 10.) Push to the remote repositories
#### 11.) Any issues would utilize outside sources (notes, google, then General Assembly issue queue)
#### 12.) Deploy to backend and client site via
```
git push heroku master
```
and
```
grunt deploy
```

## Technologies Used
HTML,
CSS,
JavaScript,
Rails.

## User Stories (front end)
#### 1.) As a user, I want to be able to < sign up & sign in > so that < I can play the wackamole game.
#### 2.) As a user, I want to be able to sign up and sign in, so that I can create, view, update and delete my own comments after each game played.
#### 3.) As a user, I to be able to Sign In to Create, Read (view one or all), Update and Delete comments under my profile, and now allow anyone other than myself to update or delete my comments>
#### 3.) As a user, I want to be able to < Sign In > so that < whenever I log in, anything that I Created, Updated or Deleted would be remembered under my User ID.
#### 4.) As a user, once i’ve signed up and signed in with a User ID  I want to be able to < change my password > so that < I can change my password that’s either memorable or in case I am worried about misplacing my password or sharing my password unknowingly >.
#### 5.) As a user, I want to be able to < Sign Out > so that < I do not have to worry about anyone going into my account to change around my scores, whether that be updating or deleting, since I have created these under my own username.
#### 6.) As a user, I want to be able to create my own new comments after I played a game.
#### 7.) As a user, I want to be able to view all the scores from the games I have played thus far, as well as view scores from previous players, to see where I match up in the game player hierarchy.
#### 8.) As a user, I want to be able to update my comments so that < I can add onto already existing comments in my user ID >
#### 9.) As a user, I want to be able to have the freedom to delete the comments and scores I hated from a previous game.
