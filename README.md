# Wack-A-Mole
### An app for aspiring comedians to make, update, view and delete their jokes.
I want to create a Wack-A-Mole game board for the front end, with a back-end API that a user can create, view, update and delete their scores before, during and after playing a game.

The game was inspired after creating a tic-tac-toe game. The developer wanted to create a game logic that would be somewhat of the opposite of that project, as well create a backend API, allowing users to create, view, update and delete all their scores.

## Scope of Project
Design and implement API
Design and implement client
Deploy apps
Make API for front end and back end
Make a repository for both front end and back end
via heroku and github

## Work flow - Planning and Development
1.) I developed an ERD of the one user to many scores diagram
2.) I wrote out user stories (link is below):
a.) For authorizations
b.) For creating, viewing, updating and deleting their scores
3.) Created a wireframe of several pages describing the user
experience and interface (view link below)
4.) I utilized notes taken from General Assembly
5.) Worked on the back end first
6.) Worked on the front end second
7.) Within the front end, I worked on each folder and file
one at a time.
8.) The process would entail, work on one part of a feature (e.g.
sign-up, sign-out, gameboard, scores), then test.
9.) Add and commit on a success on feature
10.) Push to the remote repository
11.) Any issues would utilize outside sources (notes, google, then General Assembly issue queue)

## Technologies Used
HTML
CSS
JavaScript

## User Stories
1.) As a user, I want to be able to < sign up & sign in > so that < I can play the wackamole game.
2.) As a user, I want to be able to sign up and sign in, so that I can create, view, update
3.) As a user, I to be able to Sign In to Create, Read (view one or all), Update and Delete  under my profile.>
3.) As a user, I want to be able to < Sign In > so that < whenever I log in, anything that I Created, Updated or Deleted would be remembered under my User ID.
4.) As a user, once i’ve signed up and signed in with a User ID  I want to be able to < change my password > so that < I can change my password that’s either memorable or in case I am worried about misplacing my password or sharing my password unknowingly >.
5.) As a user, I want to be able to < Sign Out > so that < I do not have to worry about anyone going into my account to change around my scores, whether that be updating or deleting, since I have created these under my own username.
6.) As a user, I want to be able to create my own scores with different names.
7.) As a user, I want to be able to view all the scores from the games I have played thus far.
8.) As a user, I want to be able to update my scores so that < I can add onto already existing scores to my user ID >
9.) As a user, I want to be able to have the freedom to delete scores I hated.

## Future considerations:
1.) Better front facing User Interface and experience
a.) Better looking fonts, background, buttons
2.) Make it catered for adults
3.) Create an API that has a motivational quote pop up after a certain amount of games.
